    <h2>Academic Background</h2>
    <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of New Mexico (UNM), USA. My expected graduation date is October 2023. Prior to my current studies, I earned an M.Sc. and a B.Sc. degree from the Mechanical Engineering Department at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2017 and 2015, respectively.</p>

    <h2>Expertise and Experience</h2>
    <p>I have accumulated eight years of experience in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) since 2015. Additionally, I have worked on computational heat transfer (CHT) during my M.Sc.</p>
    <p>During the initial phase of my Ph.D. program, I took on the challenge of enhancing the Incompact3D code by integrating a turbine model into it. As my skills and knowledge grew, I ventured into writing my own CFD code from scratch using C and MPI, which resulted in an impressive total of around 30000 lines of code. This cutting-edge code can simulate vast fluid problems, and I proudly utilized it primarily for wind farm simulations. Moreover, I adeptly managed multiple projects simultaneously, showcasing exceptional time-management abilities.</p>
    <p>In addition to my expertise in numerical and computational techniques, I have gained valuable hands-on experience with experiments during my undergraduate thesis, undergraduate project, various sessional/lab works, and course projects.</p>
