    <h2><span class="highlight">WIND4D:</span> Development of a high-fidelity massively parallel Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver from scratch, Ph.D.</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Description:</span> I developed the WIND4D solver to model and solve any fluid problems. The code is written in C and MPI from scratch, 
      approximately has more than 30000 lines of code. A concurrent precursor method (CPM) was implemented in the solver. The Finite Volume Method (FVM) was used to discretize 
      the governing equations. The solver has both Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) capabilities. There are several LES turbulence models (Lagrangian-averaged scale-dependent (LASD), Lagrangian-averaged
      scale-independent (LASI), Planar-averaged scale-dependent (PASD), Dynamic model of Germano, and Smagorinsky model, and many more) to parametrize the subgrid-scale 
      (SGS) terms. A sophisticated wall model based on local similarity law was implemented to calculate the shear stresses at the surface. HYPRE multigrid solver was used to solve the pressure Poisson equation. The code has a Time-Adaptive Wind-Turbine Model with Yaw Implementation. The code also
      features the shifted periodic boundary conditions (SPBC), two methods were implemented to achieve this. The code ran on 400 cores (that's the user limit, I believe the code
      can run on thousands of cores) in the Center for Advanced Computing and Research (CARC) at the University of New Mexico (UNM). The code provides other important features too.
      Several publications were published using the solver.

      <span class="highlight">Project Description:</span> A computational investigation using a three-by-three wind turbine array was conducted, employing large eddy simulation (LES) to evaluate wind farm performance. 
      Nine LEScases were considered, incorporating three wind speeds (7.3 ms<sup>−1</sup>, 10.4 ms<sup>−1</sup>, and 4.3 ms<sup>−1</sup>) and three yaw angles (30<sup>◦</sup>, 20<sup>◦</sup>, and 0<sup>◦</sup>), with nearly constant turbulence intensity (TI) at 12.0%. 
      The impact of wind speed and yaw angles on wake characteristics and power outputs were analyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Findings:</span> Wind speed variations have little influence in wake characteristics for any yaw angle, except for the wind speed 4.3 ms<sup>−1</sup> at the yaw angle of 20°. 
      The wake deflection is higher at higher wind speeds and with yawed wind turbines. However, the degree of wake steering is reduced at lower wind speeds, resulting in increased blockage 
      losses. At lower wind speeds, the turbulence intensity profiles show reduced deflection, particularly at the yaw angle of 20 degrees when the wind speed is 4.3 ms<sup>−1</sup>. As the flow 
      progresses downstream, the difference in the degree of deflection between the profiles becomes more apparent, regardless of the yaw angle, due to the varying wind speeds. This wake
      behavior significantly affects the power generated, especially when the turbines are yawed. The power losses are higher for the lower wind speeds, especially for the yaw angle of 20° 
      at the wind speed of 4.3 ms<sup>−1</sup>.

      the turbine is located at 4.0D downstream from the inflow plane and at the middle in the spanwise direction. The dimensions of the test 
      domain in terms rotor diameter are Lx ≈ 16.0D, Ly ≈ 8.0D and Lz ≈ 16.0D. Rotor diameter, D = 126m for both cases.
      case1: gap 0.25D(27m) while hub height = 90m.
      case2: gap 0.35D(40.5m) while hub height = 103.5m.

    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Findings:</span> Higher momentum flux through the gap for 0.35D case compared to 0.25D case. The wake for 0.25D case 
      persists longer distance compared to 0.35D case. Velocity gets more accelerated through the gap for the 0.35D case compared to the 0.25D case.
      Velocity gets more accelerated even outside the rotor plane for the 0.35D case compared to the 0.25D case. Higher turbulence intensity(TI) for 
      the 0.35D case compared to the 0.25D case. Higher TI suggests that the wake is recovered faster. Higher turbulence intensity(TI) even with lower
      incoming turbulence intensity for the 0.35D case compared to the 0.25D case.

      <span class="highlight">Findings:</span> Fig. 1 indicates that the numerical results match closely the experimental results especially in the regions of interest(three horizontal
      purple lines where the wind turbine lies). Fig. 1 shows the instantaneous flow field inside the wind farm and interactions of wake structures behind the turbines. How the wakes of
      upstream turbines are affecting the downstream turbines can be easily observed from Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. By minimizing these wake effects, we can further improve wind farm efficiency.
      And our goal in the future is to study different mechanisms to reduce the aggregated influences of the wakes in the wind farm.
