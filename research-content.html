    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Description:</span> I developed the WIND4D solver to model and solve any fluid problems. The code is written in C and MPI from scratch, 
      approximately has more than 30000 lines of code. A concurrent precursor method (CPM) was implemented in the solver. The Finite Volume Method (FVM) was used to discretize 
      the governing equations. The solver has both Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) capabilities. There are several LES turbulence models (Lagrangian-averaged scale-dependent (LASD), Lagrangian-averaged
      scale-independent (LASI), Planar-averaged scale-dependent (PASD), Dynamic model of Germano, and Smagorinsky model, and many more) to parametrize the subgrid-scale 
      (SGS) terms. A sophisticated wall model based on local similarity law was implemented to calculate the shear stresses at the surface. HYPRE multigrid solver was used to solve the pressure Poisson equation. The code has a Time-Adaptive Wind-Turbine Model with Yaw Implementation. The code also
      features the shifted periodic boundary conditions (SPBC), two methods were implemented to achieve this. The code ran on 400 cores (that's the user limit, I believe the code
      can run on thousands of cores) in the Center for Advanced Computing and Research (CARC) at the University of New Mexico (UNM). The code provides other important features too.
      Several publications were published using the solver.

      <span class="highlight">Project Description:</span> A computational investigation using a three-by-three wind turbine array was conducted, employing large eddy simulation (LES) to evaluate wind farm performance. 
      Nine LEScases were considered, incorporating three wind speeds (7.3 ms<sup>−1</sup>, 10.4 ms<sup>−1</sup>, and 4.3 ms<sup>−1</sup>) and three yaw angles (30<sup>◦</sup>, 20<sup>◦</sup>, and 0<sup>◦</sup>), with nearly constant turbulence intensity (TI) at 12.0%. 
      The impact of wind speed and yaw angles on wake characteristics and power outputs were analyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Findings:</span> Wind speed variations have little influence in wake characteristics for any yaw angle, except for the wind speed 4.3 ms<sup>−1</sup> at the yaw angle of 20°. 
      The wake deflection is higher at higher wind speeds and with yawed wind turbines. However, the degree of wake steering is reduced at lower wind speeds, resulting in increased blockage 
      losses. At lower wind speeds, the turbulence intensity profiles show reduced deflection, particularly at the yaw angle of 20 degrees when the wind speed is 4.3 ms<sup>−1</sup>. As the flow 
      progresses downstream, the difference in the degree of deflection between the profiles becomes more apparent, regardless of the yaw angle, due to the varying wind speeds. This wake
      behavior significantly affects the power generated, especially when the turbines are yawed. The power losses are higher for the lower wind speeds, especially for the yaw angle of 20° 
      at the wind speed of 4.3 ms<sup>−1</sup>.

      <span class="highlight">Project Description:</span> The influences of gap between turbine and ground were investigated. The ceneter of 
      the turbine is located at 4.0D downstream from the inflow plane and at the middle in the spanwise direction. The dimensions of the test 
      domain in terms rotor diameter are Lx ≈ 16.0D, Ly ≈ 8.0D and Lz ≈ 16.0D. Rotor diameter, D = 126m for both cases.
      case1: gap 0.25D(27m) while hub height = 90m.
      case2: gap 0.35D(40.5m) while hub height = 103.5m.

    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Findings:</span> Higher momentum flux through the gap for 0.35D case compared to 0.25D case. The wake for 0.25D case 
      persists longer distance compared to 0.35D case. Velocity gets more accelerated through the gap for the 0.35D case compared to the 0.25D case.
      Velocity gets more accelerated even outside the rotor plane for the 0.35D case compared to the 0.25D case. Higher turbulence intensity(TI) for 
      the 0.35D case compared to the 0.25D case. Higher TI suggests that the wake is recovered faster. Higher turbulence intensity(TI) even with lower
      incoming turbulence intensity for the 0.35D case compared to the 0.25D case.

      are parabolic in shape, which confirms that the location where velocity profiles are plotted is fully developed. We also observe that the finer mesh the 
      better agreement with analytical results. The validation metric (d) is calculated when the experimental probability is higher than the computation probability.

      <span class="highlight">Project Description:</span> Several experiments have been conducted to learn the behavior of different parameters related to the use of Support Vector Machines (SMV) in practice.
      Volterra expansion was used to expand the data into higher dimensional Hilbert space. Compared different classifiers (e.g., MMSE, Ridge regression). Finally, we studied the Gaussian Process Networks (GPN) by doing a few experiments. The 
      results of these experiments were explained with respect to theory. We optimized parameters for better estimation of the prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Findings:</span> To get better performance from the SVMs, we have to use optimal values of different parameters (e.g, complexity, data points, Gaussian distribution parameter).
      We can’t use the very higher or lower  value of complexity as it leads to overfitting or underfitting of the model respectively. The kernel representation of the Ridge regression solution classifies the data
      more accurately than the others as the Ridge regression solution includes the option of adding γI to the kernel matrix K. The kernel representation of the MMSE solution classifies the data poorly as the MMSE solution 
      has the zero value for gamma. Polynomial kernel produces less error, linear kernel produces more error and Gaussian is in the middle ground. when the data set is small and the number of hyperparameters is
      high, the optimization procedure becomes unpractical. Therefore, we must explore other selection criteria that have their roots in a probabilistic perspective. Although we can optimize the noise parameter,
      a good estimation can be achieved only if the noise parameter is known.
