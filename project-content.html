    <h2>Design and construction of portable experimental setup for measuring the thermal conductivity of locally available insulating materials, BSc thesis.</h2>
    <img src="pictures/project1_image.png" alt="Project 1 Image">
    <p>
      Project Description: Built accurate thermal conductivity testing setup using Brass disc, thermocouple, brass steam chamber, and stainless steel steam
generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings: Measured the thermal conductivity of locally available insulating materials achieving less than 5% deviation from manufactur-
ersâ€™ claimed values.

    <p>
      Project Description: Developed automated color sorting machine using RGB and IR sensors, conveyor belts, servo motor,
      and microcontroller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings: The device successfully sorted the products based on their color, dropped them in color specific boxes.

      Project Description: Simulated a planar laminar and a planar turbulent boundary layer flow over a flat plate using 3 different Plot3D grids 
      35x25, 69x49, 137x97 with the three different turbulence models (e.g., k-&epsilon, k-&omega, Spalart-Allmaras). All the simulations were 
      performed in Star-CCM+. The statistics were compared against emperical (e.g., Blasius, Coles) results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings: The statistics showed self-similarity of the solution. The influence of zero, adverse (causes backflow), and favorable (flow accelerates) 
      pressure gradient were observed.
