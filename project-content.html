    <p>
      Project Description: Built accurate thermal conductivity testing setup using Brass disc, thermocouple, brass steam chamber, and stainless steel steam
generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings: Measured the thermal conductivity of locally available insulating materials achieving less than 5% deviation from manufactur-
ersâ€™ claimed values.

    <p>
      Developed automated color sorting machine using RGB and IR sensors, conveyor belts, servo motor,
      and microcontroller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings: The device successfully sorted the products based on their color, dropped them in color specific boxes.
