      <span class="highlight">Project Description:</span> Built accurate thermal conductivity testing setup using Brass disc, thermocouple, brass steam chamber, and stainless steel steam generator. 
      The project demonstrates the practical application of Fourier’s law of thermal conduction. We have tested JUMBOLENE Polyethylene (PE) insulation of plain sheet
      of thickness 15mm and JUMBOLENE PE insulation with single-side aluminum foil laminated of thickness 25mm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Findings:</span> The experimental thermal conductivity of our sample is very close to the manufacturers' claimed value. The deviation here is less than 5%. The thermal
      conductivity of the sample with Al foil is lower than the plain sheet because, with foil, it has an extra layer. We can claim that our construct experimental setup is 
      accurate. From the temperature vs. time graph, the 2<sup>nd</sup>-order polynomial portion of quasi-state equilibrium is to be considered for the calculation of thermal
      conductivity.

      <span class="highlight">Project Description:</span> Our device uses both mechanical and electrical components to automatically sort products based on their colors. The setup 
      includes a conveyor belt, wooden structure, plastic wood structure (rotating disc), shaft, bearing, DC gear motor, IR sensors, RGB color sensors, servo motor, 
      microcontroller, LCD, operational amplifier, voltage regulator, transformer, breadboard. An IR sensor counts the products, and RGB color sensors detect their colors. A microcontroller controls the system, 
      instructing a servo motor to position the boxes accordingly. The system efficiently moves and sorts products based on their colors, displaying the 
      color on a screen and automating the rotation of the boxes to match the colors detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Findings:</span> The automated system efficiently sorts various colored products, moving them along a conveyor belt, and collecting them into specific 
      boxes based on their colors, all controlled by a microcontroller. The whole setup cost 40 dollars only.

      <span class="highlight">Project Description:</span> Simulated a planar laminar and a planar turbulent boundary layer flow over a flat plate using 3 different Plot3D grids 
      35x25, 69x49, 137x97 with the three different turbulence models (e.g., k-&#949;, k-&#969;, Spalart-Allmaras). All the simulations were 
      performed in Star-CCM+. The statistics were compared against empirical (e.g., Blasius, Coles, and Karman-Schoenherr) results.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Findings:</span> The statistics showed self-similarity of the solution. The influence of zero, adverse (causes backflow), and favorable (flow accelerates) 
      pressure gradients were observed. From Figure 3, we can see that k-ω deviates from the other models near the wall but matches close away from the wall.
      On the other hand, k-ε deviates from the other models away from the wall but matches close away near the wall. The Spallar-Allmaras turbulence model and 
      the Coles' mean velocity profile have mixed characteristics compared to the k-ω and k-ε models. It can be observed from Figure 4 that the 
      C<sub>f</sub> values vary from each other significantly although they are probably bounded by the approximate range of different correlations.
      The k-ω predicts higher C<sub>f</sub> (&infin; &tau;<sub>w</sub>) than the k-ε which means that the wall shear stress is higher (due to better 
      capture of the results, since the k-ω works better near the wall) in the k-ω.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Findings:</span> The order of accuracy gets closer to the formal order of accuracy as the grid resolution goes from coarse to fine. All the velocity profiles
      are parabolic in shape, which confirms that the location where velocity profiles are plotted is fully developed. We also observe that the finer mesh the 
      better agreement with analytical results. The validation metric (d) is calculated when the experimental probability is higher than the computation probability.
