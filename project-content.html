      Project Description: Built accurate thermal conductivity testing setup using Brass disc, thermocouple, brass steam chamber, and stainless steel steam
generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings: Measured the thermal conductivity of locally available insulating materials achieving less than 5% deviation from manufactur-
ers’ claimed values.

      Project Description: Developed automated color sorting machine using RGB and IR sensors, conveyor belts, servo motor,
      and microcontroller.

      Project Description: Simulated a planar laminar and a planar turbulent boundary layer flow over a flat plate using 3 different Plot3D grids 
      35x25, 69x49, 137x97 with the three different turbulence models (e.g., k-&#949;, k-&#969;, Spalart-Allmaras). All the simulations were 
      performed in Star-CCM+. The statistics were compared against emperical (e.g., Blasius, Coles, and Karman-Schoenherr) results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings: The statistics showed self-similarity of the solution. The influence of zero, adverse (causes backflow), and favorable (flow accelerates) 
      pressure gradient were observed. From figure 3, we can see that k-ω deviates from the other models near the wall but matches close away from the wall.
      On the other hand, k-ε deviates from the other models away the wall butmatches close away near the wall. The Spallar-Allmaras turbulence model and 
      the Coles' mean velocity profile have mixed characteristics compared to the that k-ω and k-ε models. It can be observed from figure 4 that the 
      C<sub>f</sub> values varies from each other significantly althoughthey are probably bounded by the approximate range of different correlations.
      The k-ω predicts higher C<sub>f</sub> (&infin; &tau;<sub>w</sub>) than the k-ε which means that the wall shear stress is higher (due to better 
      captureof the results, since the k-ω works better near the wall) in the k-ω.
