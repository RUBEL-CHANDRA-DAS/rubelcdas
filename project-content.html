      Project Description: Simulated a planar laminar and a planar turbulent boundary layer flow over a flat plate using 3 different Plot3D grids 
      35x25, 69x49, 137x97 with the three different turbulence models (e.g., k-&#949;, k-&#969;, Spalart-Allmaras). All the simulations were 
      performed in Star-CCM+. The statistics were compared against empirical (e.g., Blasius, Coles, and Karman-Schoenherr) results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings: The statistics showed self-similarity of the solution. The influence of zero, adverse (causes backflow), and favorable (flow accelerates) 
      pressure gradients were observed. From Figure 3, we can see that k-ω deviates from the other models near the wall but matches close away from the wall.
      On the other hand, k-ε deviates from the other models away from the wall but matches close away near the wall. The Spallar-Allmaras turbulence model and 
      the Coles' mean velocity profile have mixed characteristics compared to the k-ω and k-ε models. It can be observed from Figure 4 that the 
      C<sub>f</sub> values vary from each other significantly although they are probably bounded by the approximate range of different correlations.
      The k-ω predicts higher C<sub>f</sub> (&infin; &tau;<sub>w</sub>) than the k-ε which means that the wall shear stress is higher (due to better 
      capture of the results, since the k-ω works better near the wall) in the k-ω.

      Project Description: Simulated a planar laminar boundary layer flow over a flat plate using 5 different grids 8x8, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128.
      All the simulations were performed in Ansys Fluent and my own written 2D code BL for this course project. The statistics were compared against analytical results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings: the order of accuracy gets closer to the formal order of accuracy as the grid resolution goes from coarse to fine. All the velocity profiles
      are parabolic shape, which confirms that the location where velocity profiles are plotted is fully developed. We also observe that the finer mesh the 
      better agreement with analytical results. The validation metric (d) is calculated when the experimental probability is higher than the computation probability.
